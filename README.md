# Budgeting Helper Application

## Project Overview

The **Budgeting Helper Application** is a Python program designed to help users
understand and manage their weekly finances. It calculates the total cost of
items, applies tax, checks whether spending is within a set budget, tracks
leftover money, and applies a weekly allowance on a specified day.

The project is built using a **modular design**, separating core calculations,
user input, output formatting, and the main program flow.
