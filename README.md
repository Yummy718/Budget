# Budgeting Helper Application

## Overview

The **Budgeting Helper Application** is a Python-based program designed to help users
manage their weekly budget. It allows users to input a budget, add purchased items,
calculate totals with tax, and determine whether they are within budget.

The application uses a **graphical user interface (GUI)** built with **Tkinter** and
follows a **modular design** to separate core calculations, input handling, output
display, and program flow.
